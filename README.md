ðŸŽŠ RULES ðŸŽŠ:

- The game has 2 players, each taking their turn
- Each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result is added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls the dice and rolls a 1, his ROUND score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose 'Hold', which means that his ROUND is added to the GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL wins the game.
